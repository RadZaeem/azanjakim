==== Detailed Description
This is a class to render a `*cv::Mat*` with OpenGL in a widget.
It was downloaded here: https://github.com/Myzhar/QtOpenCVViewerGl

A modification is added at line 73 to 75, where Qt::FastTransformation argument is used to render video stream fast (since a faster algorithm is used to scale down the images)
